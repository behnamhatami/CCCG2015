PAPER: 49
TITLE: A Streaming Algorithm for 2-Center with Outliers in High Dimensions
AUTHORS: Behnam Hatami and Hamid Zarrabi-Zadeh

OVERALL EVALUATION: 2 (accept)
REVIEWER'S CONFIDENCE: 4 (high)

----------- REVIEW -----------
This paper was challenging to read. Uses a clever combination of techniques to come up with a
(1.8 + \epsilon) approximation algorithm.

The buffer management in CenterCase1(P) was hard to follow.

Significance: Good

Correctness: Verified most of the lemmas. Had trouble with Lemma 3. Did not see how " It is clear that B covers P\S".

Originality: Very good

Relevance : Very relevant to this conference

PAPER: 49
TITLE: A Streaming Algorithm for 2-Center with Outliers in High Dimensions
AUTHORS: Behnam Hatami and Hamid Zarrabi-Zadeh

OVERALL EVALUATION: 2 (accept)
REVIEWER'S CONFIDENCE: 4 (high)

----------- REVIEW -----------
A streaming algorithm for the 2-center problem ignoring a fixed number of outliers is presented. The authors have presented a better approximation bound. Surprisingly, the bound matched the bound for the same problem without the outliers. The algorithm is developed nicely, and the analysis looks correct.

In conclusion, reference [15] should be [6].

PAPER: 49
TITLE: A Streaming Algorithm for 2-Center with Outliers in High Dimensions
AUTHORS: Behnam Hatami and Hamid Zarrabi-Zadeh

OVERALL EVALUATION: 3 (strong accept)
REVIEWER'S CONFIDENCE: 4 (high)

----------- REVIEW -----------
This paper examines the problem of computing a 2-center ignoring outliers for high dimensional data in the streaming model. This paper presents a (1.8+epsilon)-approximate algorithm, improving the previous best result of (4+epsilon)-approximation.

The paper is very well written. The problem is well defined and the discussion of related work is comprehensive.  I particularly liked being eased into the solution with the simple 2-approximate solution. The algorithm is well explained. Overall this is a very nice paper, well above threshold for CCCG.
